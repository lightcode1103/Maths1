            <h4>INDICES</h4>
            <p>Indices, also called powers or exponents, are a concise way to express repeated multiplication, such as 2⁵, where 2 is the base and 5 is the index.  In the expression 2³, the number 2 is the base and 3 is the index. This means 2 multiplied by itself three times: 2 × 2 × 2 = 8</p>
            <h4>LAW OF INDICES</h4>
            <h4>MULTIPLICATION RULE</h4>
            <p>When multiplying powers with the same base, you add the indices. e.g: aᵐ × aⁿ = aᵐ⁺ⁿ </p>
            <h4>DIVISION RULE</h4>
            <p>When dividing powers with the same base, you subtract the index of the denominator from the index of the numerator.e.g: aᵐ ÷ aⁿ = aᵐ⁻ⁿ </p>
            <h4>POWER RULE</h4>
            <p>When a power is raised to another power, you multiply the indices.e.g: (aᵐ)ⁿ = aᵐⁿ </p>
            <h4>ZERO INDEX RULE</h4>
            <p>Any number (except 0) raised to the power of zero is equal to one. e.g: a⁰ = 1 </p>
            <h4>NEGATIVE INDEX RULE</h4>
            <p>A negative index can be expressed as the reciprocal of the same base with a positive index.e.g: a⁻ⁿ = 1/aⁿ </p>

              <h4>LOGARITHMS I</h4>
              <p> Logarithms are mathematical operations that are closely related to indices (exponents). A logarithm answers the question: "To what power must a base be raised to produce a given number?" For example, if 10=1000, then the logarithm of 1000 to base 10 is 3, which is written as log<sub>10</sub>1000=3. </p>
              <h4>LAW OF LOGARITHMS</h4>
              <h4>Product rule</h4>
              <p>The logarithm of a product is the sum of the individual logarithms: loga(XY) = logaX + logaY</p>
              <h4>QUOTIENT RULE</h4>
              <p>The logarithm of a quotient is the difference between the logarithms of the numerator and denominator:loga(X/Y) = logaX - logaY</p>
              <h4>POWER RULE</h4>
              <p>The logarithm of a number raised to an exponent is the exponent multiplied by the logarithm of the base: loga(X<sub>n</sub>) = nlogaX</p>
              <h4>CHANGE OF BASE RULE</h4>
              <p>This rule allows you to change the base of a logarithm to any other base, often used to convert between natural and common logarithms: logb(X) = logc(X) / logc(b)</p>
              <h4>ZERO RULE</h4>
              <p>The logarithm of 1 to any valid base is always 0: loga(1) = 0</p>
              <h4>IDENTITY RULE</h4>
              <p>The logarithm of a number to the same base is always 1: loga(a) = 1</p>
              <h4>INVERSE RULE</h4>
              <p>This rule states that log<sup>a</sup>a<sub>x</sub> = x, meaning the logarithm of a number that is an exponential power of the same base as the logarithm will result in the original exponent.</p>

              <h4>LOGARITHMS II</h4>
              <h4>CONCEPT OF STANDARD FORM</h4>
              <p>This is a convenient way to write very large or very small numbers.It has the form A × 10^n, where: A: is a number greater than or equal to 1 but less than 10 (1 ≤ A < 10). n: is an integer (a whole number, positive, negative, or zero). we move over each number from the point until the number is less than 10, the number of times you move it will be the power of 10 </p>
              <h4>Example</h4>
              <p>1. 178.9= 1.789 X 10<sub>2</sub>(we move the point forward over each number from the point until the number is less than 10, the number of times you move it will be the power of 10)</p>
              <p>2. 709096= 7.09096 X 10 <sub>5</sub>(we move the point forward over each number from the point until the number is less than 10, the number of times you move it will be the power of 10... The point start from the last number in a whole number)</p>
              <p>3. 0.000768 = 7.68 X 10<sub>-4</sub> (for zero decimal number, we move the point backward over each number from the point until the number is less than 10, the number of times you move it will be the negative power of 10)</p>
              <h4>CONCEPT OF MANTISSA AND CHARACTERISTIC</h4>
              <p>The characteristic is the integer part of a logarithm, and the mantissa is the positive fractional part of the logarithm. For example, in log₁₀ 200 = 2.3010, the characteristic is 2 and the mantissa is 0.3010. The mantissa is always a positive value less than 1.</p>
              <h4>CHARACTERISTIC</h4>
              <p>The characteristic is the integer part of a common logarithm.</p>
              <h4>How to find it (for numbers ≥ 1)</h4>
              <p>It's one less than the number of digits to the left of the decimal point.</p>
              <p>(a) For 21735 (5 digits), the characteristic is 5 - 1 = 4.</p>
              <p>(b) For 350 (3 digits), the characteristic is 3 - 1 = 2.</p>
              <h4>How to find it (for numbers < 1)</h4>
              <p>It's negative and related to the number of zeros after the decimal point.</p>
              <p>(a) For 0.035 (one zero after the decimal point), the characteristic is -2.</p>
              <p>(b) For 0.00065 (one zero after the decimal point), the characteristic is -4.</p>
              <h4>MANTISSA</h4>
              <p>The mantissa is the positive decimal part of the logarithm. The mantissa is always a positive value between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). It is found using a logarithm table. If the decimal part of a logarithm is negative, it must be converted to its positive equivalent. </p>
              <p>Example: For log₁₀ 0.08 ≈ -1.097, the mantissa is adjusted: -1.097 + 1 = 0.903. The characteristic becomes -1 - 1 = -2</p>
              <h4>How to use Logarithms table</h4>
              <p>To use a common logarithm table, you must first separate the number into its characteristic (integer) and mantissa (decimal) parts, with the mantissa always being positive. Then, use the first two digits of the number for the row and the third digit for the column in the main log table to find the mantissa's base value. Finally, use the fourth digit for the mean difference column to find the adjustment, add it to the base value, and combine it with the characteristic to get the final log value.</p>

              <h4>OPERATION ON LOGARITHMS</h4>
              <h4>STEP ON FINDING THE LOGARITHMS OF A NUMBER</h4>
              <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Determine the characteristic by counting the number of digits before the decimal point (if greater than 1, it's positive; if less than 1, it's negative and depends on the number of zeros after the decimal).</p>
              <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find the mantissa using the log table, which provides the decimal part of the logarithm for the number's significant digits.</p>
              <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Combine the characteristic and the positive mantissa to get the logarithm.</p>
              <h4>Finding logarithms of a number</h4>
              <p>1. 4.986 = characteristics is 4-1=3, while the mantissa using the log table 49 under 8 difference 6= 6972 + 5= 0.6977 ,then add the characteristic and mantissa = 3 + 0.6977 =3.6977</p>
              <p>2. 8750= characteristic is 4-1=3, while the mantissa using the log table 87 under 5 (there is no diff 0) =0.9420, then add the caharacteristic and mantissa = 3 + 0.9420 =3.9420 </p>
              <p>3. 0.058.72 = characteristics is -2 because is a zero decimal with two zero before a significant number, while the mantissa using the log table 58 under 7 difference2= 0.7687, then add the characteristics and mantissa= -2 + 0.7687 = -2.7687</p>
               <h4>MULTIPLICATION METHOD</h4>
               <p>find the individual logarithms</p>
               <p>For  multiplication, you will add individual log value</p>
               <h4>Example</h4>
               <p>1. 4.986 X 8750</p>
               <p>
                log 4.986= 3.6977, while log 8750 = 3.9420..... you will add both value 3.6977 + 3.9420= 7.6397, then check the antilog.
               </p>
               <p>2. 18.67 X 8.065</p>
               <p>log 18.67 = 1.2711, while log 8.065=0.9066..... you will add both value 1.2711 + 0.9066=2.1777,then check the antilog.</p>
               <h4>DIVISION METHOD</h4>
               <p>find the individual logarithms</p>
               <p>For  Division, you will subtract individual log value </p>
               <h4>Example</h4>
               <p>1. 4.986 X 8750</p>
               <p>
                log 4.986= 3.6977, while log 8750 = 3.9420..... you will subtract both value 3.6977 - 3.9420=-0.2443, then check the antilog.
               </p>
               <p>2. 18.67 X 8.065</p>
               <p>log 18.67 = 1.2711, while log 8.065=0.9066..... you will subtract both value 1.2711 - 0.9066=0.3645, then check the antilog.</p>
               <h4>POSITIVE POWER METHOD</h4>
               <p>For Power, you will multiply the log value by the number of the power</p>
               <h4>Example</h4>
               <p>1.4.986<sub>2</sub></p>
               <p>log 4.986 = 3.6977.... you will multiply it by 2 due to the power is raise to 2....ANS= 3.6977 X 2= 7.3954, then check the antilog.</p>
               <p>2. 18.67<sub>3</sub></p>
               <p>log 18.67 = 1.2711..... you will multiply it by 3 due to the power is raise to 3.....ANS= 1.2711 X 3=3.8133, then check the antilog.</p>
               <h5>ROOT METHOD</h5>
                <p>For Root, you will divide the log value by the number of the root.. example of root a<sub>1/2</sub>, a<sub>1/3</sub> etc,</p>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>1. 8.065<sub>1/2</sub></p>
                <p>log 8.065=0.9066..... you will divide it by 2 due to the root is 2....Ans 0.9066/2= 0.4533</p>
                <p>2. 8750<sub>1/3</sub></p>
                <p>log 8750= 3.9420...... you will divide it by 3 due to the root is 2.... ANS 3.9420/3= 1.314</p>

              <h4>SET THEORY</h4>
              <p> Set is a collectio of well defined distinct objects. Objects in terms of human being, things, letters, numbers etc.</p>
              <p>E.g. The set of natural numbers N= {1,2,3,4,5,......}</p>
              <p> The set intergers Z= {..... -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,.....} etc</p>
              <p> These objects are called element of the set.</p>
              <p> Set is denoted by a capital letters. E.g. A,B,C etc.</p>
              <h4>MEMBERSHIP OF A SET</h4>
              <p> The elements of a set are called the members of a set. It is denoted by a Greek letter E (called epsilon).</p>
              <p>E.g, if set A= {a,b,c,d}, then we write a∈A, b∈A, c∈A, d∈A</p>
              <p>if a∈A, we say that "a" is an element of A</p>
              <p>"a" is a member of A(a belongs to A)</p>
              <h4>TYPES OF SET</h4>
              <h4>EMPTY SET/NULL SET</h4>
              <p>An empty set is a set that contains no element in it. It is denoted by either {} or ∅. Note: {0} is not an empty set </p>
              <h4>SUBSET OF A SET</h4>
              <p>The subset of a set that can be found in another set. it is denoted by a Greek letter ⊂.</p>
              <p> if all the elements of set A can be found in set B, we say that A is a subset of B and write A⊂B.</p>
              <p>Note: Empty set is a subset of any set, and every set is a subset of itself.</p>
              <p><span>Example 1:</span> Write out  the subset of the following sets (a) A={a,b,c}   (b) B={a,b,c,d}</p>
              <h4>solution</h4>
              <p>(a) A= {a,b,c}; The subsets are  {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b}, {a,c}, {b,c}, {a,b,c} , ∅ (There are 8 subsets in the set).</p>
              <p>(b) A= {a,b,c,d}; The subsets are {a}, {b}, {c}, {d}, {a,b}, {a,c}, {a,d},{b,c},{b,d}, {c,d}, {a,b,c}, {a,b,d}, {a,c,d}, {b,c,d}, {a,b,c,d}, ∅ (There are 16 subsets in the set).</p>
              <h4>UNIVERSAL SET</h4>
              <p>This is called mother set. it is the set containing all objects or elements and of which all other sets are subsets.</p>
              <p>The universal set usually denoted by S,ξ of U</p>
              <p>For example, Nigeria is a universal set, and all the states inside it are the subsets.</p>
              <h4>FINITE AND INFINITE SET</h4>
              <p>A set is said to be finite, if it has finite(countable) number of element in it and it is otherwise called infinite set</p>
              <p>For example</p>
              <p>A= {1,2,3,4,5,.....} is an infinite set</p>
              <p>B= {1,2,3,4,5} is a finite set</p>

              <h4>PROPERTIES OF SETS</h4>
              <h4>CARDINALITY OF A SET</h4>
              <p>The cardinality of set A or the cardinal number, is the total element in set A. it is denoted as n(A). e.g if A = {a,b,c,d}, then n{A} = 4.</p>
              <h4>COMPLEMENT OF A SET</h4>
              <p>Let A be set, then the complement of set A are the elements that cannot be found in set A, but can be found in the universal set. Complement of set A is denoted by A' or Aᶜ.</p>
              <p>For example, if U = {1,2,3,4,a,b,c,d}, A= {1,2,3,a,b,c} and B={2,3,4,b,c,d}, and B={2,3,4,b,c,d} then Aᶜ= {4,d} and Bᶜ={1,a}</p>
              <h4>OPERATION OF SETS</h4>
              <h4>UNION OF SETS A AND B</h4>
              <p>The union of sets A and B is the set of elements belonging to either set A or B (or both). The union of sets is denoted by the sign ∪.</p>
              <p><span>Example:</span>Given sets</p>
              <p>A= {2,3,a,b} B={3,4,b,c} and C= {1,4,c,d}. Compute (a) A∪B  (b) AUC   (c) BUC</p>
              <p>solution</p>
              <p>(a) A U B = {2,3,a,b} U {3,4,b,c}= {2,3,4,a,b,c}</p>
              <p>(b) A U C= {2,3,a,b} U {1,4,c,d} = {1,2,3,4,a,b,c,d}</p>
              <p>(c) B U C= {3,4,b,c} U {1,4,c,d} = {1,3,4,c,d}</p>
              <h4>INTERSECTION OF SETS A AND B</h4>
              <p> The intersection of sets A and B is the set of elements that are common to both sets A and B. Is the set of elements can be both found in sets A and B at the same time.</p>

              <p>Intersection of sets is denoted by the sign '∩'</p>
              <p><span>Example 5:</span>Given sets A = {2,3,a,b} B={3,4,b,c} and C= {1,4,c,d}. Compute (a) A∩B  (b) A∩C (c) B∩C </p>
              <p>Solution</p>
              <p>(a) A∩B = {3,b}</p>
              <p>(b) A∩C = {} or ∅</p>
              <p>(c) B∩C = {4,c}
              </p>
              <h4>DISJOINT SETS</h4>
              <p>Sets that have nothing in common are called disjoint sets. Sets A and C above are disjoint sets. if sets A and B are disjoint, then A∩B = empty ={} = ∅</p>
              <h4>SET BUILDER NOTATION</h4>
              <p>Sometimes a set can be written in word problem form, this is called set builder notation. The following are example of such Sets
              </p>
              <p>1. A= {x:x is a set of natural number less than 10} i.e A= {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}</p>
              <p>2. A= {x:x is a set of perfect square less than 50} i.e A= {1,4,9,16,25,36,49}</p>
              <p>3. A= {x: 2< x< 8} These are values greater than 2 and less than 8 i.e A= {3,4,5,6,7}</p>

                <h4>VENN DIAGRAM</h4>
                <p>A venn diagram is an illustration of the relationship between and among sets, groups of objects that share something in common. Usually, venn diagrams are used to depict (represent by a drawing) set intersections. This type of diagram is used in scientific and engineering presetations, in theorical mathematics, in computer applications and in statistics.</p>
                <p> A simple and very useful way of representing sets, is by using Venn diagram (named after an English mathematician and philosopher, John Venn, (1834 - 1883).</p>

              <h4>NUMBER SYSTEM</h4>
              <p>
                A number system to the base P, where P is a positive integer is a system consisting of the digits 0,1,2,3.....P -2,P -1. The number sytems that we shall consider are:
              </p>
              <p>a. Decimal System</p>
              <p>b. Binary System</p>
              <p>c. Octal System</p>
              <p>d. Hexadecimal system</p>
              <h4>DECIMAL SYSTEM</h4>
              <p>The decimal system is a number system to the base ten and it consists of the following digir 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.</p>
              <h4>Arithmetic in base ten</h4>
              <p>The elementary operations in arithmetic are:</p>
              <p>a. Addition</p>
              <p>b. Subtraction</p>
              <p>c. Multiplication</p>
              <p>d. Division</p>
              <h4>Addition in base ten</h4>
              <p>The digits with the same positional or place value are added together, starting from the right. if the sum of the digits is a multiple of ten, zero is written down, and the face value of the multiple of ten is carried over to the immediate positional value to the left, and the procedure is repeated till all the digits are added. if the sum of the digits exceeds a multiple of ten, the excess is written down, and the face value of the multiple of ten is carried over to the next positional value</p>
              <h4>Example3</h4>
              <p>Find the following sums in base ten</p>
              <p>a. 238 + 495= 733</p>
              <p>b. 473 + 509 + 624 = 1606</p>
              <p>c. 849.36 + 3564.92 = 4414.28</p>
              <h4>Subtraction in base ten</h4>
              <p>In subtraction, digits from the subtrahend are subtracted from the corresponding digits from the minuends with the same positional values. if a digit from the subtrahend is greater than the corresponding digit from the minuend, one is borrowed from the immediate neighbour on the left and that one counts at ten.' Ten added to the digit in the minuend now serves as new minuend and the operation is continued.</p>
              <h4>Example</h4>
              <p>Evaluate each of the following:</p>
              <p>a. 8421 - 3842 = 4579</p>
              <p>b. 496.7 - 346.3 = 150.4</p>
              <p>c. 7894.26 - 5986.37 = 37</p>
              <h4>BINARY SYSTEM</h4>
              <P>The binary system is a system of numbers which has two as its base. The digits in base two atr 0 and 1. Computers are made on the mechanism of a 'two-way device' system.</P>
              <h4>Addition in base two</h4>
              <p>Addition in base two is accomplished in a manner similar to addition in base ten. when two digits are added and their sum is greater than 1, the multiples of two are carried over while the remainder is written down. if there are more than two numbers to be added, addition is usually done cumulatively. just as we have a binary point in base two system.</p>
              <h4>Example</h4>
              <p>Evaluate each of the following in base two:</p>
              <p>a. 1011 + 1101 = 11000</p>
              <p>b. 1111101 + 1011011 = 11011000</p>
              <p>c. 1011.01 + 1101.10 = 11000.11</p>
              <h4>Subtraction in base two</h4>
              <p>Subtraction in base two is similar to that of base ten, except that if a digit in a subtrahend is greater than the corresponding digit of a minuend, 1 is 'borrowed' from theimmediate neighbour of the digit of the minuend. This'borrowed' 1 has a place value of 2 and it is added to the digit of the minuend. The digit of the subtrahend can then be subtracted from the sum.</p>
              <h4>Example</h4>
              <p>Evaluate each of the following in base two</p>
              <p>a. 11101.01 - 10100.11 = 1000.11</p>
              <p>b. 1111011.11 - 1011110.10 = 11101.01</p>
              <p>c. 111101.01 - 10111.11 = 100101.10</p>
              <h4>OCTAL SYSTEM</h4>
              <p> The Octal system is a number system in base eight. The digits consist of 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.</p>
              <h4>Addition and Subtraction</h4>
              <p>Addition and subtraction in base eight are very much similar to addition and subtraction in base ten respectively.</p>
              <h4>Example</h4>
              <p>Evaluate each of the following in base eight</p>
              <p>a. 374₈ + 246₈ = 642₈</p>
              <p>b. 561₈ + 743₈ = 1524₈</p>
              <p>c. 645₈ - 352₈ = 273₈</p>
              <h4>HEXADECIMAL SYSTEM</h4>
              <p>A number system , using sixteen as it base is called a Hexadecimal system. The hexadecimal system has the following digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F. </p>
              <h4>Example</h4>
              <p>a. 3F4C<sub>16</sub> + B52D<sub>16</sub> = F479<sub>16</sub></p>
              <p>b. F9B8<sub>16</sub> - D46E<sub>16</sub> = 254A<sub>16</sub></p>

              <h4>Conversion to base ten</h4>
              <p>A number system to an arbitrary base can be converted to base ten in two ways by using</p>
              <p>a. Expanded notation.</p>
              <p>b. Extended multiplication</p>
              <h4>Example1</h4>

              <h4>Conversion from base ten to an Arbitrary Base</h4>
              <p>The conversion of a decimal number into a number in a given base, is accomplished by successively didviding the decimal number by the given base. The array of reminders in the successive division, gives the required number in the given base. The method is called the <strong>Method of Successive Division</strong></p>
              <h4>Example</h4>

              <h4>SIMPLE EQUATION AND VARIATION </h4>
              <h4>SIMPLE EQUATION</h4>
              <p>An equation is a mathematical statement that shows equality between two expressions.There are different forms of equation, one of them being linear equation.</p>
              <p> A linear equation is a mathematical statement that contains only terms in one variable and constant, and the highest power of the variable is 1. The left hand side always equals the right hand side of the equation.</p>
              <h4>Examples of linear equation are:</h4>
              <p>(a) 2x + 6 = 16</p>
              <p>(b) 3x - 9= 4x - 25</p>
              <p>(c) 3(y + 2) = 8y + 10</p>
              <br>
              <p>Using different operations, linear equations are solved by finding values of different variables which are the unknowns. we must note that equations can be solved by</p>
              <br>

              <h4>VARIATIONS</h4>
              <p>The word variation(Proportion) is used to describe the relations which exist between two quantities. Supposing a worker is paid at a certain rate for every hour that he works, the total wages due to him in a given period will depend on the hours he works. Let us say tha H1 and H2 represent the hours wored in any two given periods and R1 and R2, represent the wages earned, we can then state that</p>
              <br>
              <p><sup>H1</sup>&frasl;<sub>H2</sub> = <sup>R1</sup>&frasl;<sub>R2</sub> </p>
              <br>
              <p>The four quantities given above are examples of proportion, hence a kind of variation exists among them. if the ratio of the H1 and H2 above are therefore constant, then H1 and H2 are said to vary directly.
              <p> Apart from the above example, if in another situation a ratio between quantity y and quantity x is constant, y is also said to be vary directly as x. This is written as y &alpha; x which is read as y is proportional to or vary as x. There are different types of variation as discussed below.
                <h4>DIRECT VARIATION</h4>
                <p>when two quantities H and R are related, to the extent that</p>
                <br>
                <p><sup>H1</sup>&frasl;<sub>H2</sub> = <sup>R1</sup>&frasl;<sub>R2</sub> </p>
                <br>
                Given that R1 and R2 are any two values of R and also H1 and H2 are the corresponding values of H1, therefore, H is said to vary directly as R. 
                <h4>Constant of Variation</h4>
                <p>In a certain real life situation, the following are example of direct variation</p>
                <p>(a) The circumference of a circle will vary directly as the diameter or the radius</p>
                <p>(b) The electrical resistance of a wire will vary directly as the length.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Therefore if A &alpha; B, then for A to be equal to B, there must be a quantity to multiply B so as to be equal to A.</p>
                <p>Hence, given A  &alpha; B</p>
                <p>Then, one can state, A=BK where K is the constant. In any given problem on variation, it is the constant that must be found first so as to find other values when one is given.</p>
                <h4>Example1:</h4><span>Given that y varies directly as x, when x=3, y=6, calculate y when x=7.5 and x when y=16.5</span>
                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>y &alpha; x</p>
                <p>y=xK (k= constant of variation)</p>
                <p>But y=6 when x=3 then 6=3K .. K= 2</p>
                <p>To find y when x= 7.5, k being 2</p>
                <p>y=xk</p>
                <p>y= 7.5 X 2= 15</p>
                <p> Also to find x when y=16.5; k being 2</p>
                <p>y=kx</p>
                <p>16.5=2x</p>
                <p>x=16.5/2 = 8.25</p>
                <h4>Example2:</h4>
                <p>If the resistance R Newtons to the motion of a moving vehicle varies directly as the square of the speed Vkm/hr, write down the relationship between R and V. Given that R=600Newtons when V= 20. Find the</p>
                <p>(a) Speed when the resistance is 337.5 Newtons</p>
                <p>(b) resistance given that the speed is 32km/hr</p>
                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>if R=Resistance and V=Speed, then the relationship between R and V will be </p>
                <p>R  &alpha; V<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p>R= v<sup>2</sup>k (which is the relationship)</p>
                <p>(a) when R= 600 and v= 20, k can be got thus: 600 = 20<sup>2</sup>K</p>
                <p>600=400k.... k=1.5</p>
                <p>Hence when R= 337.5Newtons, speed will be</p>
                <p>R=v<sup>2</sup>k</p>
                <p>337.5= 1.5v<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p>v<sup>2</sup>= 337.5/1.5</p>
                <p>v<sup>2</sup>= 225</p>
                <p>v=&radic;225</p>
                <p>v= 15km/hr</p>
                <p>(b) Also Resistance can be got at a speed of 32km/hr</p>
                <p>R= v<sup>2</sup>k</p>
                <p>R= 32<sup>2</sup>k</p>
                <p>R= 1024 X 1.5 = 1536Newtons</p>
                <br>
                <h4>INVERSE VARIATION</h4>
                <p>If two quantities are so related such that the increase in one of them leads to the decrease in the other or vice versa, then the first one is said to vary inversely as the second. For example, if a bus travelling at a given speed tends to increase such speed, the less time it will take the bus to cover a given distance.</p>
                <p>Therefore in an inverse variation, the product of the two variables(quantities) will result in a constant. For instance if y varies inversely as x, it is written as y  &alpha; 1/x.. Therefore y=k/x where k=constant.</p>
                <p>The following are among the many inverse variations that we may come across:</p>
                <p>1. Time travelled in a given distance varies inversely as the speed</p>
                <p>2. The volume of mass of gas varies inversely as the pressure</p>
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <p>Given that y varies inversely as the square of x and y= 8 when x=2, find the equationconnecting y and x. Calculate the value of y when x=6 and x when y=1/2</p>
                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>y &alpha; 1/ x<sup>2</sup>
                <p>y= k/ x<sup>2</sup> which is the required equation</p>
                <p>8=k/2<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p>8=<sup>k</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></p>
                <p>k= 32</p>
                <p>when x=6</p>
                <p>y=k/x<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p>y=32/6<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p>y=<sup>32</sup>&frasl;<sub>36</sub></p>
                <p>y=<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub></p>
                <p>when y=<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></p>
                <p>y=k/x<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> = 32/x<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p>x<sup>2</sup>= 2 X 32= 64</p>
                <p>x= &radic;64</p>
                <p>x=8.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>JOINT VARIATION</h4>
                <p>when the value of a quantity is proportional to two or more other quantities, we say that a joint variation has occured. The only quantity is thereby said to vary jointly as the two other quantities, e.g the volume of a cylinder v varies jointly as the height h and also directly as the square of the radius r of the base of the cylinder. This is written as v &alpha; r<sup>2</sup>h... Therefore v= &pi;r<sup>2</sup>h</p>
                <p>In solving problems which involve joint variation, the same process of finding the constant is followed as under direct and inverse variations.</p>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>if y varies directly as d and inversely as the square of x. if d=30, x=24 and y=1/18, find the law connecting the variables. Also find y when d=5 and x=2</p>
                <h4>Solution</h4><span> y &alpha; d and y &alpha; 1/x<sup>2</sup></span>
                <p>y&alpha; d &alpha; 1/x<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p>y &alpha; <sup>d</sup>&frasl;<sub>x<sup>2</sup></sub></p>
                <p>y= <sup>dk</sup>&frasl;<sub>x<sup>2</sup></sub></p>
                <p>when y=<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub>, d=30, x=24</p>
                <p><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub>= <sup>30k</sup>&frasl;<sub>24<sup>2</sup></sub></p>
                <p><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub>= <sup>30k</sup>&frasl;<sub>576</sub></p>
                <p>k= <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>18</sub> X <sup>576</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub></p>
                <p>k= <sup>16</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub></p>
                <p>Therefore the law connecting the variables will be:</p>
                <p>y= <sup>16d</sup>&frasl;<sub>15x<sup>2</sup></sub></p>
                <p>To find y when d=5, x=2</p>
                <p>y= <sup>16x5</sup>&frasl;<sub>15x2<sup>2</sup></sub></p>
                <p>y= <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></p>
